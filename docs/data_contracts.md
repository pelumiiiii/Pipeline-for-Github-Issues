# Data Contracts

## GitHub Issues (bronze/github/issues*)
| Field | Type | Description |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `id` | integer | Immutable GitHub issue identifier. |
| `number` | integer | Repository-scoped issue number. |
| `title` | string | Issue title, cleaned of leading/trailing whitespace. |
| `state` | string | Issue state (`open`, `closed`, etc.). |
| `user_login` | string | GitHub login of the author (alias of `user.login`). |
| `comments` | integer | Count of comments at extraction time. |
| `created_at` | timestamp | ISO-8601 creation time (UTC). |
| `updated_at` | timestamp | ISO-8601 last update time (UTC). Used as checkpoint cursor. |
| `closed_at` | timestamp/null | Closure time when applicable. |
| `ingest_ts` | timestamp | Pipeline ingestion timestamp (UTC). |

### Quality Rules
- All records must pass Pydantic validation before landing in bronze storage.
- `updated_at` increases monotonically per source run and drives checkpointing.
- Records with `pull_request` keys are skipped to avoid mixing PRs with issues.

## Local Sales CSV (bronze/sales/raw)
- Schema is inferred from CSV headers. Keep CSV files consistent and document any changes via pull requests.

## GitHub Issues Silver (silver/github/issues)
| Field | Type | Description |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `id` | integer | GitHub issue identifier (primary key). |
| `repo_owner` | string | Repository owner. |
| `repo_name` | string | Repository name. |
| `number` | integer | Issue number within the repository. |
| `state` | string | Current state (`open`). |
| `user_login` | string | Reporter login (hashed or obfuscated if required). |
| `created_at` | timestamp | Issue creation timestamp (UTC). |
| `updated_at` | timestamp | Last update timestamp used as freshness cursor. |
| `ingest_ts` | timestamp | Pipeline ingestion timestamp. |
| `priority_label` | integer | Target label (1 if high priority based on comment volume). |
| `title_length` | float | Character length of the title. |
| `title_word_count` | float | Word count of the title. |
| `issue_age_days` | float | Age of the issue at extraction time. |
| `time_since_update_days` | float | Days since the last update. |
| `is_recent_update` | integer | 1 if updated within the last 7 days. |
| `is_weekend_created` | integer | 1 if created on Saturday/Sunday. |
| `repo_issue_count_30d` | float | Count of repo issues opened in the last 30 days (prior to this issue). |
| `repo_issue_count_90d` | float | Same as above but 90-day window. |
| `user_issue_count_30d` | float | Reporter history count over 30 days. |
| `user_issue_count_90d` | float | Reporter history count over 90 days. |
| `title_has_bug` | integer | 1 if the title contains the token "bug". |
| `title_has_error` | integer | 1 if the title references "error". |

### Notes
- Train/validation/test splits are time-based and stored under `split=train|val|test` subdirectories.
- `_meta.json` contains metadata (commit hash, feature columns, missing percentages, data cut).
- Silver represents current-state snapshotsâ€”use snapshots or derived gold datasets for time-travel modelling.

### Change Management
- Breaking schema changes require updating this contract and migrating downstream tables.
- Notify data consumers before modifying required fields or data types.
